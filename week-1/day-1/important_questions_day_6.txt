4. Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
- To handle a side-effect like API and it will get called after we have the initial render.

5. What is Optional Chaining?
- If we don't know whether the properties are available on the object or not, In that case, we can use Optional chaining.
- If properties are not available then we don't check ahead and return 'undefined' to a user.
 
6. What is Shimmer UI?
- It's a UI that we can show to the user when we don't have any data to show.
- While getting Data from API we can show the shimmer effect to the user.

7. What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement
- If some operation/written thing returns a Value then it is a JS expression otherwise it is a JS Statement

8. What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example
- It is a Ternary Operator that we can use in React Component 
eg:    {isLoggedIn ? (
        <img
          src="https://icon-library.com/images/sign-out-icon/sign-out-icon-10.jpg"
          style={{ height: 50, width: 50 }}
          onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(false)}
        />
      ) : (
        <img
          src="https://www.iconpacks.net/icons/2/free-user-icon-3296-thumb.png"
          style={{ height: 50, width: 50 }}
          onClick={() => setIsLoggedIn(true)}
        />
      )}
 
9. What are async and await? 
- if we use async ahead of any function then that function is now asynchronous.
- It won't stop the main thread.
- await keyword is used to reloved the promise.

10. What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in  getRestaurants()
- It will return a JSON object(readable) from the stream of data that the fetch API has given.
