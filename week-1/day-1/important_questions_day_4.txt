- We only require a key when we have the same Tag's sibling of the same parent otherwise React is smart enough to identify on its own.

9. Can we use the index as keys in React?
- We can use but React doesn't recommend it because if we add the new element in between, then the key will get changed for the below elements of the newly added element, and then differentiating those elements at the Reconciliation process would cause some bugs.
